#### Starting the client

yarn package manager is used to manage the client side of the start app. It should have been installed when the environment was created. If not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
conda install conda-forge::yarn
```

CD into the client directory and run ```yarn``` to install the required packages. Run the following command to start the client:

```bash
yarn start
```

This should start the client on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and open it in your default web browser.
